# slim-community

**Greetings, SLiMulators!**

This is a community organization for users of SLiM.  It contains repositories for projects related to SLiM, and hosts discussions among SLiM users.  We welcome members from the SLiM community who want to get involved, contribute a project, or just feel like chatting.

## Further Resources
There are some other sites you should be aware of:

* The [SLiM home page](https://messerlab.org/slim/), part of the [Messer Lab](https://messerlab.org) website.  This is where you can find manuals, downloads, announcements, information about the [SLiM Workshop](https://messerlab.org/slim/#Workshops), videos about SLiM, and other information provided by Ben Haller and the Messer Lab.

* The [SLiM repository on GitHub](https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM).  This is where the source code for SLiM and SLiMgui resides.  Mostly you'd go here if you wanted to download an older release of SLiM, or build SLiM from sources, but the code is all there if you want to delve into it!

* The [`slim-announce`](https://groups.google.com/g/slim-announce) and [`slim-discuss`](https://groups.google.com/g/slim-discuss) mailing lists.  Most people sign up for `slim-discuss`; this is where you can ask questions about how to use SLiM and its scripting language Eidos, and get help and answers from the community.  Announcements of things like SLiM workshops also appear on `slim-discuss`.  If you only want the announcements, and don't want to see questions and answers, then subscribe to `slim-announce` instead.

* The [SLiM-Extras](https://github.com/MesserLab/SLiM-Extras) repository.  This repository is, as its name says, intended for "extras" associated with SLiM itself, such as example recipes that didn't make the cut to be in the manual, testing code for validating the behavior of SLiM, installer scripts, and small code snippets that don't deserve to be a repository in their own right.  Larger chunks of SLiM-related content produced by the community that merit a whole repository of their own belong here in `slim-community`.

* The [tskit-dev](https://tskit.dev) website.  This is the home of [`tskit`](https://tskit.dev/software/tskit.html) and related projects â€“ [`msprime`](https://tskit.dev/software/msprime.html), [`pyslim`](https://tskit.dev/software/pyslim.html), [`tsinfer`](https://tskit.dev/software/tsinfer.html), [`tsdate`](https://tskit.dev/software/tsdate.html), and many other projects.  The `tskit` ecosystem is closely related to SLiM, since SLiM uses `tskit` for its tree-sequence recording feature.

* Other projects that use SLiM as a back end, such as [`stdpopsim`](https://github.com/popsim-consortium/stdpopsim), [`slendr`](https://www.slendr.net), [`shadie`](https://github.com/elissasoroj/shadie), [`slimr`](https://rdinnager.github.io/slimr/), and [`py_ped_slim`](https://github.com/MiguelGuardado/py_ped_sim).

* There are lots of other community resources for SLiM as well.  See section 1.10 of the SLiM manual for a more comprehensive list.

We look forward to connecting with you!
